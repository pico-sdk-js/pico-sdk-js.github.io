# Why use JavaScript?

The [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) is an incredibly versatile microcontroller, perfect for hobbyists and professionals alike. However, programming it can feel daunting for those unfamiliar with C or C++. Enter **Pico-SDK-JS**: a game-changing engine that lets you write applications for your Raspberry Pi Pico using JavaScript or TypeScript. Here’s why you should consider using Pico-SDK-JS for your next project.

## Why JavaScript?
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world. By leveraging JavaScript to program your Raspberry Pi Pico, you gain access to a massive ecosystem of developers, libraries, and resources. Here are some key benefits:

1. **Ease of Learning**: JavaScript is beginner-friendly, making it an excellent choice for anyone new to microcontrollers or programming in general.
2. **Rapid Development**: Its forgiving syntax and real-time feedback loop help you prototype and iterate faster.
3. **Cross-Platform Skills**: If you’re already familiar with JavaScript for web development, transitioning to hardware programming with Pico-SDK-JS is seamless.

## Why TypeScript?
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) builds on JavaScript by adding optional static typing and modern language features. For projects requiring robust, scalable code, TypeScript is a fantastic option. Here’s why:

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime, making your applications more reliable.
2. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Features like IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring tools improve productivity.
3. **Scalability**: With TypeScript, managing larger, more complex projects becomes significantly easier.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Pico-SDK-JS provides templates and examples to easily transpile TypeScript to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Why Pico-SDK-JS?
The Pico-SDK-JS engine bridges the gap between modern development practices and microcontroller programming. Here’s how it stands out:

1. **Ease of Installation**: Set up your development environment quickly with straightforward installation steps.
2. **Direct Access to Pico-SDK Functions**: Leverage the power of the underlying C functions from JavaScript or TypeScript.
3. **Testing Made Simple**: Pico-SDK-JS simplifies testing with robust tools and example projects.
4. **Vibrant Community**: Join a growing community of developers pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with JavaScript on microcontrollers.

## Get Started Today!
Whether you’re a beginner looking to dip your toes into microcontroller programming or an experienced developer seeking a modern and efficient workflow, Pico-SDK-JS makes programming your Raspberry Pi Pico easier and more fun.
